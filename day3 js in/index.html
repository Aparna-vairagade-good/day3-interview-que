   <div> <p> 1. How many operators do we have in JS ?</p>

    <pre>There are different types of JavaScript operators:
        Arithmetic Operators:
        1) + addition 
        2) - subtraction
        3) *- multiplication
        4) / - division
        5) % - modulus
        6) ++ - increment
        7) -- - decrement
        Assignment Operators:
        1) =
        2) +=
        3) -=
        4) *=
        5) /=
        6) %=
        7) **=
        
        Comparison Operators:
        1) == 
        2) ===
        3) !=
        4) !==
        5) >
        6) < 
        7) >=
        8) <=
        9) ?
        Logical Operators:
        1) &&
        2) ||
        3) !
        Conditional Operators:</pre></div>

<div><p>2. What are arrow functions?</p> 
    <p>An arrow function expression is a compact alternative to a traditional function expression, with some semantic 
        differences and deliberate limitations in usage: Arrow functions don't have their own bindings to this , 
        arguments , or super , and should not be used as methods.</p>
<pre>let hello = "";
    hello = () => {
      return "Hello World!";
    }
    hello();

    output: Hello World!
</pre>
    </div>

<div><p>3. Difference between undefined vs not defined vs NaN</p>
    <p>In JavaScript, they both are related to memory space and there is a very simple difference between them. 
        If the variable name which is being accessed doesn’t exist in memory space then it would be not defined, 
        and if exists in memory space but hasn’t been assigned any value till now, then it would be undefined.
        <br>
        In JavaScript, NaN is short for "Not-a-Number".
        In JavaScript, NaN is a number that is not a legal number.
        The Number.isNaN() method returns true if the value is NaN, and the type is a Number.</p>
    
    <pre>let x;
        if (x === undefined) {
          text = "x is undefined";
        } else {
          text = "x is defined";
        }
        console.log(text)
    
        output: x is undefined
    </pre>
    
    <pre>console.log (a)

        output:not defined
    </pre>
    
    <pre>let y = NaN;
        console.log(y)

    output: NaN</pre>
</div>

<div><p>4. What is callback hell</p>
    <p>The phenomenon which happens when we nest multiple callbacks within a function is called a callback hell. 
        The shape of the resulting code structure resembles a pyramid and hence callback hell is also called the 
        “pyramid of the doom”. It makes the code very difficult to understand and maintain.</p>
    <pre>function CallBackDemo() {
        CallBackDemo1()
        function CallBackDemo1() {
            CallBackDemo2()
            function CallBackDemo2() {
                CallBackDemo3()
                function CallBackDemo3() {
                    CallBackDemo4()
                    function CallBackDemo4() {
                        console.log("Callback Functon");
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
    CallBackDemo()

    output:Callback Function
    </pre>
</div>

<div><p>5. Please explain Self Invoking Function and its code</p>
    <p>A self-invoking expression is invoked (started) automatically, without being called. Function expressions 
        will execute automatically if the expression is followed by (). You cannot self-invoke a function declaration.</p>
    <pre>(function () {
        console.log("Hello! I called myself")
        })();

        output: Hello! I called myself
    </pre>
</div>

<div><p>6. What is the use of setTimeout</p>
    <p>setTimeout() The global setTimeout() method sets a timer which executes a function 
        or specified piece of code once the timer expires.</p>
    <pre>const myTimeout = setTimeout(myGreeting, 5000);
         function myGreeting() {
          console.log("Happy Birthday!")
         }

         output: Happy Birthday! after 5sec
    </pre>
